Assume there are 3 Systems
Each system config
16cores  1 core is give to OS
32GB RAM 2GB is given to OS
   

Worker will have 15 cores and 30GB RAM
Total cluster resources
Memory = 90GB
Cores = 45Cores

/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --executor-memory 16G --executor-cores 8 --total-executor-cores 24 

num of executors = 24/8 = 3 
Each executor will have 8 cores
Each executor will have 16GB RAM. 
Cannot have more than 1 executor in a node

/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit --executor-memory 10G --executor-cores 5 --total-executor-cores 30

num of executor = 30/5 = 7
Each executor will have 5 cores
Each executor will have 10GB RAM.
Can have upto 3 executor per node
